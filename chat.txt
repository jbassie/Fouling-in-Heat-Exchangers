You can start with it for a “pipeline shakeout” (data loading → preprocessing → train → evaluate), but I would not treat it as scientifically trustworthy yet without a few sanity checks. There are some red flags in the file that strongly suggest either (a) the fouling variables are defined opposite to what the column names imply, or (b) the simulator used to generate the data has a sign/units mistake.

Here’s what I see in your dataset (5000 rows, 15 columns):

The columns are structurally good for a home project
You have the right kind of fields: inlet temps, outlet temps, mass flow rates, two fouling terms (hot/cold), plus calculated quantities (Q, U, h’s, iteration/error). That’s enough to train a model and demonstrate the concept.

Major physics-consistency warning
In a normal heat exchanger, higher fouling resistance should reduce heat transfer. That usually means:

Hot outlet temperature should go up (hot side cools less)

Cold outlet temperature should go down (cold side heats less)

Heat duty Q should go down

Overall U should go down

In your file, the opposite trend appears: when R_f_hot or R_f_cold increases, Q_actual tends to increase and T_cold_out tends to increase, while T_hot_out decreases. That pattern is inconsistent with “fouling resistance” as engineers typically define it.

What that means practically:

Either your “R_f_*” columns are not actually fouling resistances (they might be a cleanliness factor, or a heat transfer enhancement term, or inverted units), OR

The equations used to generate the dataset treat fouling with the wrong sign (e.g., added incorrectly in the overall resistance), OR

There’s leakage/definition mismatch (e.g., “R_f” is being computed from temperatures in a way that flips interpretation).

Potential leakage risk for machine learning
If your goal is “predict fouling from measured signals,” then you should NOT include variables that are mathematically derived using fouling in the forward simulator (because the model will learn to reverse-engineer the label with unfair information).

High-risk leakage columns:

U_overall

h_hot

h_cold

error, iteration (these are solver artifacts, not plant measurements)

If you feed those into the transformer, you’ll get excellent accuracy that will not translate to any realistic deployment scenario.

So: what you should do next (simple, decisive)
Step 1: Decide the intended prediction problem.
Most defensible setup:

Inputs (X): m_dot_hot, m_dot_cold, T_hot_in, T_cold_in, T_hot_out, T_cold_out (and optionally timestamp if you want time-series)

Targets (y): R_f_hot and R_f_cold (or their sum as total fouling)

Step 2: Run two sanity checks on the dataset (takes 10 minutes).
A. “Does increasing fouling reduce U and Q?”
Compute correlation or bin averages:

If R_f increases and U/Q also increase, your fouling definition is likely inverted or wrong.

B. “Is U consistent with the usual resistance structure?”
Even roughly, U should drop as (R_f_hot + R_f_cold) increases.

Step 3: If the sanity checks fail, still use the file for coding practice, but don’t build your thesis contribution on it.
In that case, you should regenerate the synthetic data from your own verified Effective-NTU simulator (even if it’s simpler at first). That gives you credibility and control.

My recommendation (strong and practical)

Yes, use this dataset immediately to validate your end-to-end ML workflow and transformer code (preprocessing, splits, training loop, metrics).

No, don’t treat it as your final “physics-generated truth” until you confirm the fouling relationships behave physically.

And for modeling, drop U_overall, h_hot, h_cold, error, iteration from the feature set to avoid leakage.

If you want, I can tell you exactly what to look for by listing the expected direction of change for each variable (U, Q, T_hot_out, T_cold_out) when you increase R_f_hot while holding flows and inlet temps constant. That single check will immediately confirm whether “R_f” is being used correctly in the generator.
